1.What is JAVA?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for portability, reliability, and ease of use. It follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle, meaning Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2.C vs Java vs Python

C: Procedural language, platform-dependent, manual memory management.
Java: Object-oriented, platform-independent, automatic memory management via garbage collection.
Python: Interpreted, dynamically-typed, and known for simplicity.

3.JVM Works
 How JVM works - JVM Architecture
The JVM executes Java bytecode. It consists of:

Class Loader: Loads .class files.
Bytecode Verifier: Ensures code security.
Execution Engine: Converts bytecode into machine code.

4.Differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM
JDK: Includes tools for development and the JRE.
JRE: Provides the libraries and JVM to run Java applications.
JVM: Executes the Java bytecode.
Analogy: JDK = Kitchen, JRE = Cooking tools, JVM = Stove.

5.Difference between Bytecode and Machine Code
Bytecode: Intermediate code executed by the JVM.
Machine Code: Hardware-specific binary instructions.
Example: Bytecode (.class) is portable, while machine code is platform-dependent.

Q5.
The Acme Tennis Ball Company is designing a new box to ship its products. The marketing department wants a triangular box that can hold 4 balls, as in the illustration below. The balls fi t exactly inside the box, just touching all three walls and the end caps of the container. All 3 walls of the box are the same size (equilateral triangle). Assume a tennis ball is 6 cm in diameter, and ignore the thickness of the box material. What will be the length and breadth of the material used to make the box? Write a program that fi nds the measure of a side of the box. Program must also display the length and breadth of the material used to make the triangular box.
The formula to be applied for the above problem is:
side = sqrt(3)*diameter
length = side*3
breadth = 4*diameter
Input Format
The input consists of the diameter of the box.
Output Format
The output displays the side of the box, length and breadth of the material used to make the triangular box separated by a space.

Q7.
Trade Fair
Trade Fairs are important for companies to present their products and to get in touch with its customers and business parties. One such grandeur Trade Fair Event was organized by the Confederation of National Large Scale Industry.
Number of people who attended the event on the fi rst day was
x
. But as days progressed, the event gained good response and the number of people who attended the event on the second day was twice the number of people who attended on the fi rst day. Unfortunately due to heavy rains on the third day, the number of people who attended the event was exactly half the number of people who attended on the fi rst day.
Given the total number of people who have attended the event in the fi rst 3 days, fi nd the number of people who have attended the event on day 1, day 2 and day 3.
Input Format
First line of the input is an integer value that corresponds to the total number of people.
Output Format
First line of the output should display the number of attendees on day 1.
Second line of the output should display the number of attendees on day 2.
Third line of the output should display the number of attendees on day 3.
Sample Input
10500
Sample Output
Number of attendees on day 1 : 3000
Number of attendees on day 2 : 6000
Number of attendees on day 3 : 1500

Q8.
Problem statement
Alice wanted to start a business and she was looking for a venture capitalist. Through her friend Bob, she met the owner of a construction company who is interested to invest in an emerging business. Looking at the business proposal, the owner was very much impressed with Alice's work. So he decided to invest in Alice's business and hence gave a green signal to go ahead with the project. Alice bought Rs. X for a period of Y years from the owner at R% interest per annum. Find the rate of interest and the total amount to be given by Alice to the owner. The owner impressed by the proper repayment of the fi nanced amount decides to give a special offer of 2% discount on the total interest at the end of the settlement. Find the amount given back by Alice and also fi nd the total amount. (Note: All rupee values should be in two decimal points).

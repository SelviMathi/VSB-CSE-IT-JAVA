Exception:
An exception in Java (or any programming language) is an error. It is an unexpected break in the program's flow that can cause the program to crash.

Exception handling:
Java provides a structured way to handle exceptions using:

try block – Contains code that may throw an exception.
catch block – Handles the exception if one occurs.
finally block – Executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
throw keyword – Used to explicitly throw an exception.
throws keyword – Declares exceptions that a method can throw.


Types of Exception

Checked Exception
The exception that can be predicted by the programmer at the compile time.
Example : File that need to be opened is not found.

Unchecked Exception
Unchecked exceptions are the class that extends RuntimeException. 
Example: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, Array Index out of Bound exception.

Error
Errors are typically ignored in code because you can rarely do anything about an error.
Example : if stack overflow occurs,that error cannot be handled in the code.


Common scenarios where exceptions may occur


1) Scenario where ArithmeticException occurs
	int a=50/0;
2) Scenario where NullPointerException occurs
	String s=null;  
	System.out.println(s.length());
 3) Scenario where NumberFormatException occurs
	String s="abc";  
	int i=Integer.parseInt(s);
4) Scenario where ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs
	int a[]=new int[5];  
	a[10]=50;

Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.		      Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
Checked exception cannot be propagated using throw only.		          Checked exception can be propagated with throws.
Throw is used within the method.				                             	Throws is used with the method signature.
You cannot throw multiple exceptions			                        		You can declare multiple exceptions e.g.
									                                                    public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.


Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
It is keyword

Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
It is block

Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
it is method
